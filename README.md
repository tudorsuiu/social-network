<h2>‚ÑπÔ∏è About</h2>
This Social Network desktop app, made by a student using JavaFX, helps you connect with other users. You can create an account, add or delete friends, view your friends list, and see how long you've been friends with someone.


<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Functionalities</h2>
‚úÖ <strong>Account creation:</strong> <i>Users should be able to create an account with their personal information, such as name, email, age and password.</i>
<br>
‚úÖ <strong>Friend requests:</strong> <i>Users can search for and send friend requests to other users. Once a friend request is accepted, the two users become friends.</i>
<br>
‚úÖ <strong>Friend list:</strong> <i>Users can view a list of their current friends and their profiles. This list should include their friend's name, email and age.</i>
<br>
‚úÖ <strong>Unfriend option:</strong> <i>Users can unfriend someone from their friend list.</i>
<br>
‚úÖ <strong>Friendship duration:</strong> <i>By selecting a user from the list and pressing a button, the day you became friends will appear on the screen.</i>
<br>
‚¨ú <strong>Messaging:</strong> <i>Users can send and receive private messages to their friends, either one-on-one or in a group chat. The messaging feature should support text and emojis.</i>

<h2>üß† Key learnings</h2>

- <strong>Database:</strong> <i>I learned how to connect to a PostgreSQL database and how to use it in my application.</i>
- <strong>Design patterns:</strong> <i>I understood better the concept of "Design patterns" and why it should be implemented in any application.</i>
- <strong>GUI with JavaFX:</strong> <i>I learned how to link the logical part of the program and the part of the graphic interface with which the user interacts by using JavaFX.</i>
- <strong>Readability of code:</strong> <i>Writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain is essential for ensuring code quality and improving developer productivity.</i>

<h2>üìà Project status</h2>
The project is <strong>nearly finished</strong>. The chat feature is the only thing left to implement. I'm considering the following implementation of this feature: The connected user will select a different user from his friends list and click the "Send message" button to start a chat between them in a new window.
